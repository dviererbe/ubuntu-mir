:microscope: You can test your commits **without** *appending* to a PR by creating a new branch with that extra change and pushing it to your fork. The [check-spelling](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/check-spelling) action will run in response to your **push** â€“ it doesn't require an open pull request. By using such a branch, you can limit the number of typos your peers see you make. :wink:
